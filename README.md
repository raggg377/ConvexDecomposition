# ConvexDecomposition

Decomposition of concave polygon into convex polygons making use of the algorithm described in the paper: Fernández, J., Cánovas, L., & Pelegrı́n, B. (2000). Algorithms for the decomposition of a polygon into convex polygons. European Journal of Operational Research, 121(2), 330-342. 

Data structure used is a Doubly Connected Edge List.


The file to run is main.cpp while the testcases are taken from the testcases folder. The testcase1.txt is a good sample testcase to understand the input format. The output is obtained in merge and decompose folders for their respective tasks. The file visualizations.ipynb can be used to plot these outputs.
